# PENZ Classes Frontend
> An online class app that allows users to see all available courses, reserve a spot in a class, see all reservations, add and delete courses. 

The app consumes an API created using the Ruby on Rails framework. Link to API repo [PENZ Classes Backend](https://github.com/enkog/Penz_Classes_Backend).

## Project Requirements

- You should follow the layout of [the provided design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/26425031/Vespa-Responsive-Redesign). You should change only the titles, descriptions, and photos - in order to create a website about something other than motorcycles.

- Select a theme for your website - is it going to be a website for booking doctor appointments, booking online classes, or something else?

- The user logs in to the website, only by typing the username.

- In the navigation panel, the user can see links to:

	- Motorcycles/doctors/classes/items that you selected as a theme.

	- "Reserve" form.

	- "My reservations".

	- "Add motorcycle/doctor/class/item that you selected as a theme" (if you are in a group of 4 people the link is visible to everybody).

	- "Delete motorcycle/doctor/class/item that you selected as a theme" (if you are in a group of 4 people the link is visible to everybody).

- On the main page, the user can see a [list of motorcycles/doctors/classes/items that you selected as a theme](https://www.behance.net/gallery/26425031/Vespa-Responsive-Redesign/modules/173005577).

- When the user selects a specific item, they can see the [details page](https://www.behance.net/gallery/26425031/Vespa-Responsive-Redesign/modules/173005579) with its full description (skip the "Rotate image" button).

- In the details page, the user can click the "Reserve" button (in the design you can see the "Configure" button - please replace it with the "Reserve" button).

- When the user clicks the "Add item" link in the navigation panel they can see a form for adding a new item.

- Make the app responsive, creating both mobile and desktop versions.

- When the user clicks the "Delete item" link in the navigation panel they can see a list of all items with title and "Delete" button.

- When the user clicks the "Delete" button, the selected item is marked as removed and does not show on the main list anymore.

- To reserve an appointment, the user has to select a date and city (username and selected item are autofilled).

- Use the design based on the ["Book a vespa test-ride"](https://www.behance.net/gallery/26425031/Vespa-Responsive-Redesign/modules/173005583) and add all necessary inputs.

- The user can also access the "Reserve" page from the navigation panel. In that case only username is autofilled.

- When the user clicks the "My reservations" link in the navigation panel they can see a list of their reservations (with information about item name, date and city).
